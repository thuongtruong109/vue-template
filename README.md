> **Note**: If you are seeking for better Vue developer experience and more consistent maintenance, we recommend using [Nuxt 3](https://nuxt.com) instead (it also works perfectly with SPA or SSG as needed). This template still serves as a reference, but expect slower updates.

## Why

I have created several Vite apps recently. Setting the configs up is kinda the bottleneck for me to make the ideas simply come true within a very short time.

So I made this starter template for myself to create apps more easily, along with some good practices that I have learned from making those apps. It's strongly opinionated, but feel free to tweak it or even maintain your own forks.

## Variations

As this template is strongly opinionated, the following provides a curated list for community-maintained variations with different preferences and feature sets. Check them out as well. PR to add yours is also welcome!
